# Problem

A spanning tree of an undirected graph with N nodes is a tree with N-1 edges that uses only edges from N and includes all nodes in N.

Please construct a graph with at least 2 nodes, and no more than 22 nodes, such that the graph has exactly K different spanning trees. (Two spanning trees are considered different if and only if the sets of edges that they use are different.) The graph must have at most one edge per pair of nodes, and must not contain a loop (an edge from a node to itself).

It is guaranteed that at least one such graph exists for every K within the limits below.

## Solving this problem

This problem has only 1 Small dataset and no Large dataset. You will be able to retry the dataset (with a time penalty).

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of one line with an integer K: the desired number of spanning trees.
