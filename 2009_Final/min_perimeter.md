# Problem

You will be given a set of points with integer coordinates. You are asked to compute the smallest perimeter of a triangle with distinct vertexes from this set of points.

## Input

The first line of the input data gives you the number of cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case contains on the first line the integer n, the number of points in the set. n lines follow, each line containing two integer numbers xi, yi. These are the coordinates of the i-th point. There may not be more than one point at the same coordinates.
