# Problem

I have a set of positive integers S. Can you find two non-empty, distinct subsets with the same sum?

Note: A subset is a set that contains only elements from S, and two subsets are distinct if they do not have exactly the same elements.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow, one per line. Each test case begins with N, the number of positive integers in S. It is followed by N distinct positive integers, all on the same line.
