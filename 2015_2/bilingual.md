# Problem

Elliot's parents speak French and English to him at home. He has heard a lot of words, but it isn't always clear to him which word comes from which language! Elliot knows one sentence that he's sure is English and one sentence that he's sure is French, and some other sentences that could be either English or French. If a word appears in an English sentence, it must be a word in English. If a word appears in a French sentence, it must be a word in French.

Considering all the sentences that Elliot has heard, what is the minimum possible number of words that he's heard that must be words in both English and French?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each starts with a single line containing an integer N. N lines follow, each of which contains a series of space-separated "words". Each "word" is made up only of lowercase characters a-z. The first of those N lines is a "sentence" in English, and the second is a "sentence" in French. The rest could be "sentences" in either English or French. (Note that the "words" and "sentences" are not guaranteed to be valid in any real language.)
