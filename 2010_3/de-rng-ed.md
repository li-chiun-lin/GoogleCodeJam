# Problem

I want to make an online poker website. A very important component of such a system is the random number generator. It needs to be fast and random enough. Here is a compromise I came up with. I need a way to generate random numbers of length at most D. My plan is to select a prime number P â‰¤ 10D. I am also going to pick non-negative integers A and B. Finally, I'm going to pick an integer seed S between 0 and P-1, inclusive.

To output my sequence of pseudo-random numbers, I'm going to first output S and then compute the new value of S like this:
S := (A*S + B) mod P.

Then I will output the new value of S as the next number in the sequence and update S again by using the same formula. I can repeat this as many times as I want.

Do you think that this is a good random number generator? Can you write a program that takes K consecutive elements of a sequence that was generated by my random number generator, and prints the next element of the sequence?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each one starts with a line containing D and K. The next line contains K consecutive elements generated by a random number generator of the kind described above.
