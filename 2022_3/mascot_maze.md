# Problem

The Google Coding Competitions team is setting up a new theme park. As in any good theme park, we want to have actors dressed up as mascots to interact with visitors. Because we are in a rush to open, we decided to use the letters from CODE JAM, KICK START, and HASH CODE as mascots, for a total of 13 different mascots (the letters ACDEHIJKMORST).

The park's only attraction is a maze that has a set of N rooms numbered from 1 to N. Each room has a left exit and a right exit. Each exit takes the visitor to another room. Exits cannot be used in reverse; for example, if room 2 has an exit to room 3, you cannot go back from room 3 to room 2 unless room 3 also happens to have an exit to room 2.

Illustration of Sample Case #1.

We want to place exactly one of our 13 mascots in each room. Each letter may be present in zero, one, or more rooms of the maze. To increase variety, we want to place mascots so that any three (not necessarily distinct) rooms that a visitor can visit consecutively have three different mascots.

Can you help us choose a mascot for each room such that this goal is met, or let us know that it cannot be done?
