# Problem

When she is bored, Mija sometimes likes to play a game with matrices. She tries to transform one matrix into another with the fewest moves. For Mija, one move is swapping any two rows of the matrix or any two columns of the matrix.

Today, Mija has a very special matrix M. M is a 2N by 2N matrix where every entry is either a 0 or a 1. Mija decides to try and transform M into a checkerboard matrix where the entries alternate between 0 and 1 along each row and column. Can you help Mija find the minimum number of moves to transform M into a checkerboard matrix?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer: N. The next 2N lines each contain 2N characters which are the rows of M; each character is a 0 or 1.
