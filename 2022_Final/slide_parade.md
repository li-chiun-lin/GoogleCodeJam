# Problem

Gooli is a huge company that owns B
buildings in a hilly area, numbered 1 through B

. Six years ago, Gooli built slides that allowed employees to go from one building to another. Each slide allows anyone to go from the slide's origin building to the slide's destination building, but not the other way around. Gooli's CEO is very proud of their slides and wants to organize a parade through the slides. She has tasked Melek, Gooli's Head of Transportation and a problem-solving enthusiast, with designing the parade's route.

Illustration of Sample Case #5.

She has some requirements for the parade route in mind:

- It must start and end at building 1, where her office is located.
- It must visit each building the same number of times. Being in building 1 at the start of the route does not count as a visit.
- It must use each slide at least once.
- It must have at most 10^6 steps.

Given the layout of buildings and slides, help Melek find a route that satisfies all of the CEO's requirements, if one exists.
