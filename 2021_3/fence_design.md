# Problem

You are hired as a temporary employee of the Fence Construction Company and have been tasked with finishing the design of the fencing for a field. Each fence must run in a straight line between two poles. Each pole occupies a single point and the location of each pole is fixed. No three poles are collinear. Fences cannot intersect each other, except possibly at their endpoints (the poles).

The design was started by someone else, but they quit the project after adding exactly two fences. You need to finish their design. To impress your bosses and clients, you want the design to have as many fences as possible, regardless of their lengths.

Given the positions of the poles and the already-built fences, please find a way to add as many fences as possible such that no pair of fences (new or existing) intersect each other, except possibly at their endpoints (the poles).
