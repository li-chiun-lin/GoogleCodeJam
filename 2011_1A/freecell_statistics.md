# Problem

I played D (D > 0) games of FreeCell today. Each game of FreeCell ends in one of two ways -- I either win, or I lose. I've been playing for many years, and have so far played G games in total (obviously, G ≥ D).

At the end of the day, I look at the game statistics to see how well I have played. It turns out that I have won exactly PD percent of the D games today, and exactly PG percent of G total games I had ever played. Miraculously, there is no rounding necessary -- both percentages are exact! Unfortunately, I don't remember the exact number of games that I have played today (D), or the exact number of games that I have played in total (G). I do know that I could not have played more than N games today (D ≤ N).

Are the percentages displayed possible, or is the game statistics calculator broken?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line contains 3 integers -- N, PD and PG.
