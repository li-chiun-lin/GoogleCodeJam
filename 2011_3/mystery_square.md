# Problem

I have written down a large perfect square in binary, and then replaced some of the digits with question marks. Can you figure out what my original number was?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow, one per line. Each line contains S: a perfect square written in binary, but with some of the digits replaced by question marks.
