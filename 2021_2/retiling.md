# Problem

Cody-Jamal's latest artistic installment is a tiled kitchen floor that can be retiled to different patterns. The floor consists of a matrix of R
rows and C

columns of square tiles. Each tile is reversible, one side is magenta and the other one is green.

To retile the kitchen, there are two allowed operations:

    flip a tile, changing its visible color from magenta to green, or vice versa, and
    swap two adjacent tiles (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally), without flipping either.

Viewing Cody-Jamal's artistic floor is free, but interacting with it is not. Performing a single flip operation costs F
coins, and performing a single swap operation costs S

coins.

You can see the current state of the floor and want to turn it into a particular pattern. What is the minimum amount of coins you need to spend to achieve your goal?
