# Problem

Little John likes palindromes, and thinks them to be fair (which is a fancy word for nice). A palindrome is just an integer that reads the same backwards and forwards - so $6$, $11$ and $121$ are all palindromes, while $10$, $12$, $223$ and $2244$ are not (even though $010=10$, we don't consider leading zeroes when determining whether a number is a palindrome).

He recently became interested in squares as well, and formed the definition of a fair and square number - it is a number that is a palindrome and the square of a palindrome at the same time. For instance, $1$, $9$ and $121$ are fair and square (being palindromes and squares, respectively, of $1$, $3$ and $11$), while $16$, $22$ and $676$ are not fair and square: $16$ is not a palindrome, $22$ is not a square, and while $676$ is a palindrome and a square number, it is the square of $26$, which is not a palindrome.

Now he wants to search for bigger fair and square numbers. Your task is, given an interval Little John is searching through, to tell him how many fair and square numbers are there in the interval, so he knows when he has found them all.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ lines follow.  
Each line contains two integers, $A$ and $B$ - the endpoints of the interval Little John is looking at.
