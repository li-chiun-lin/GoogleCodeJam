# Problem

I have a string S consisting of lower-case alphabetic characters, 'a' - 'z'. Each maximal sequence of contiguous characters that are the same is called a "run". For example, "bookkeeper" has 7 runs. How many different permutations of S have exactly the same number of runs as S?

Two permutations a and b are considered different if there exists some index i at which they have a different character: a[i] â‰  b[i].

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each contains a single non-empty string of lower-case alphabetic characters, S, the string of interest.
