# Problem

You just made a new friend at an international puzzle conference, and you asked for a way to keep in touch. You found the following note slipped under your hotel room door the next day:

"Salutations, new friend! I have replaced every digit of my phone number with its spelled-out uppercase English representation ("ZERO", "ONE", "TWO", "THREE", "FOUR", "FIVE", "SIX", "SEVEN", "EIGHT", "NINE" for the digits 0 through 9, in that order), and then reordered all of those letters in some way to produce a string S. It's up to you to use S to figure out how many digits are in my phone number and what those digits are, but I will tell you that my phone number consists of those digits in nondecreasing order. Give me a call... if you can!"

You would to like to call your friend to tell him that this is an obnoxious way to give someone a phone number, but you need the phone number to do that! What is it?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of one line with a string S of uppercase English letters.
