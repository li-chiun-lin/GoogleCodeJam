# Problem

Vida says she's part Elf: that at least one of her ancestors was an Elf. But she doesn't know if it was a parent (1 generation ago), a grandparent (2 generations ago), or someone from even more generations ago. Help her out!

Being part Elf works the way you probably expect. People who are Elves, Humans and part-Elves are all created in the same way: two parents get together and have a baby. If one parent is A/B Elf, and the other parent is C/D Elf, then their baby will be (A/B + C/D) / 2 Elf. For example, if someone who is 0/1 Elf and someone who is 1/2 Elf have a baby, that baby will be 1/4 Elf.

Vida is certain about one thing: 40 generations ago, she had 240 different ancestors, and each one of them was 1/1 Elf or 0/1 Elf.

Vida says she's P/Q Elf. Tell her what is the minimum number of generations ago that there could have been a 1/1 Elf in her family. If it is not possible for her to be P/Q Elf, tell her that she must be wrong!
