# Problem

You have just got the best gift ever, a Pogo stick. The pogo stick is something you use to jump off the ground while standing on it.

This Pogo stick is a special one: the first jump will move you a distance of 1 unit, the second jump will move you 2 units, the third jump will move you 3 units and so on. You can jump in only four directions using this stick: north (increasing y), south (decreasing y), east (increasing x) or west (decreasing x).

Now you want to play a game in your backyard, which we model as an infinite plane. You are standing with your stick in at point (0, 0) and you want to go to point (X, Y).

The point (X, Y) will never be (0, 0), and it will always be reachable from your starting point.

Check the output section carefully, because the required outputs for the small and large datasets are not the same.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow, one per line. Each line consists of 2 integers separated by a single space, X and Y, the coordinates of the point you want to reach.
