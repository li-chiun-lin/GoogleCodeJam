You've become addicted to the latest craze in collectible card games, PokeCraft: The Gathering. You've mastered the rules! You've crafted balanced, offensive, and defensive decks! You argue the merits of various cards on Internet forums! You compete in tournaments! And now, as they just announced their huge new set of cards coming in the year 2010, you've decided you'd like to collect every last one of them! Fortunately, the one remaining sane part of your brain is wondering: how much will this cost?

There are many possible combinations for a booster pack where no card is repeated. When you pay for one pack, you will get any of the possible combinations with equal probability. You buy packs one by one, until you own all the C kinds. What is the expected (average) number of booster packs you will need to buy?
