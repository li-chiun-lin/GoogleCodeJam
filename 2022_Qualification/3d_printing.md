# Problem

You are part of the executive committee of the Database Design Day festivities. You are in charge of promotions and want to print three D's to create a logo of the contest. You can choose any color you want to print them, but all three have to be printed in the same color.

You were given three printers and will use each one to print one of the D's. All printers use ink from **4** individual cartridges of different colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to form any color. For these printers, a color is uniquely defined by **4** non-negative integers ***c***, ***m***, ***y***, and ***k***, which indicate the number of ink units of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink (respectively) needed to make the color.

The total amount of ink needed to print a single D is exactly **10<sup>6</sup>** units. For example, printing a D in pure yellow would use **10<sup>6</sup>** units of yellow ink and **0** from all others. Printing a D in the Code Jam red uses **0** units of cyan ink, **500,000** units of magenta ink, **450,000** units of yellow ink, and **50,000** units of black ink.

To print a color, a printer must have at least the required amount of ink for each of its **4** color cartridges. Given the number of units of ink each printer has in each cartridge, output any color, defined as **4** non-negative integers that add up to **10<sup>6</sup>**, such that all three printers have enough ink to print it.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case consists of **3** lines. The ***i***-th line of a test case contains **4** integers **C<sub>i</sub>**, **M<sub>i</sub>**, **Y<sub>i</sub>**, and **K<sub>i</sub>**, representing the number of ink units in the ***i***-th printer's cartridge for the colors cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, respectively.

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #***x***: ***r***, where ***x*** is the test case number (starting from 1) and ***r*** is IMPOSSIBLE if there is no color that can be printed by all **3** printers. Otherwise, ***r*** must be equal to ***"c m y k"*** where ***c***, ***m***, ***y***, and ***k*** are non-negative integers that add up to **10<sup>6</sup>** and ***c*** ≤ ***C<sub>i</sub>***, ***m*** ≤ ***M<sub>i</sub>***, ***y*** ≤ ***Y<sub>i</sub>***, and ***k*** ≤ ***K<sub>i</sub>***, for all ***i***.
