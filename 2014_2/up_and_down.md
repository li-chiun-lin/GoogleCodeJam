# Problem

You are given a sequence of distinct integers A = [A1, A2, ..., AN], and would like to rearrange it into an up and down sequence (one where A1 < A2 < ... < Am > Am+1 > ... > AN for some index m, with m between 1 and N inclusive).

The rearrangement is accomplished by swapping two adjacent elements of the sequence at a time. Predictably, you are particularly interested in the minimum number of such swaps needed to reach an up and down sequence.

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer: N. The next line contains N distinct integers: A1, ..., AN.
