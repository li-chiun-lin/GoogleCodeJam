# Problem

Many terminals use asterisks (*) to signify "any string", including the empty string. For example, when listing files matching BASH*, a terminal may list BASH, BASHER and BASHFUL. For *FUL, it may list BEAUTIFUL, AWFUL and BASHFUL. When listing B*L, BASHFUL, BEAUTIFUL and BULL may be listed.

In this problem, formally, a pattern is a string consisting of only uppercase English letters and asterisks (*), and a name is a string consisting of only uppercase English letters. A pattern p matches a name m if there is a way of replacing every asterisk in p with a (possibly empty) string to obtain m. Notice that each asterisk may be replaced by a different string.

Given N patterns, can you find a single name of at most 104 letters that matches all those patterns at once, or report that it cannot be done?

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line with a single integer N: the number of patterns to simultaneously match. Then, N lines follow, each one containing a single string Pi representing the i-th pattern.

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is any name containing at most 104 letters such that each Pi matches y according to the definition above, or * (i.e., just an asterisk) if there is no such name.
