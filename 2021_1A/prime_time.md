# Problem

You are playing a new solitaire game called Prime Time. You are given a deck of cards, and each card has a prime number written on it. Multiple cards may have the same number.

Your goal is to divide the cards into two groups in such a way that the sum of the numbers in the first group is equal to the product of the numbers in the second group. Each card must belong to exactly one of the two groups, and each group must contain at least one card. The sum or product of a group that consists of a single card is simply the number on that card.

Sample Case #1

For example, in the image above, the left group has cards whose sum is 25
and the right group has cards whose product is 25. Therefore, this is a valid split into groups.

Your score is the sum of the numbers in the first group (which is equal to the product of the numbers in the second group), or 0 if you cannot split the cards this way at all. What is the maximum score you can achieve?
