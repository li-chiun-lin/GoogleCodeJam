# Problem

There is an exam with Q true or false questions. The correct answer to each question is either T or F. Each student taking the exam selects either T or F for each question, and the student's score is the number of questions they answer correctly.

Example Exam

There are N students who have already taken this exam. For each of those students, you know the answers they gave to each question and their final score. Assuming that any sequence of answers that is consistent with all of those students' scores has the same probability of being the correct sequence of answers, you want to maximize your own expected score. Determine what that expected score is and how to answer the questions so that you achieve it.
