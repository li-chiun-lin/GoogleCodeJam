# Problem

You are holding a party. In preparation, you are making a drink by mixing together three different types of fruit juice: Apple, Banana, and Carrot. Let's name the juices A, B and C.

You want to decide what fraction of the drink should be made from each type of juice, in such a way that the maximum possible number of people attending the party like it.

Each person has a minimum fraction of each of the 3 juices they would like to have in the drink. They will only like the drink if the fraction of each of the 3 juices in the drink is greater or equal to their minimum fraction for that juice.

Determine the maximum number of people that you can satisfy.

## Input

    One line containing an integer T, the number of test cases in the input file.

For each test case, there will be:

    One line containing the integer N, the number of people going to the party.
    N lines, one for each person, each containing three space-separated numbers "A B C", indicating the minimum fraction of each juice that would like in the drink. A, B and C are integers between 0 and 10000 inclusive, indicating the fraction in parts-per-ten-thousand. A + B + C ≤ 10000.
